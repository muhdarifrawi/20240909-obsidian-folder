In the midst of the cool morning fog, a masked man walks down the street towards a gated mansion. He pulls on the door rope and a minute later, a butler was seen walking towards the gate. An elderly gentleman wearing glasses greeted this masked man.

"May I help you?" He voice soft as he asked.

The masked man pulled out a letter and a metallic card, handing it over the the butler. The butler looked over the letter and then held up the card. He closed his eyes and chanted quietly. The card glowed white. Happy with the results, he opened the gate.

"Come in." The butler gestured him in and lead the way.

They passed through the main hall and into what looks like a study room. The fireplace was lit and sat facing to it was a man. The fire lit his face in the dark, painting an unkempt man with a worried face. He did not react to the two entering the room, lost in his thoughts. 

"Sir, the help has arrived." The butler did a slight bow as he introduced their guest. He handed over the letter and card over to his master.

As how the butler did, the master of the house read the letter and verified through the card. 

"Thank you Graham. Please Mr Mahjuur, take a seat. "

Mahjuur took the offer and sat. 

"I have a brief understanding of the situation from the guildmaster Mr Leofric. If you don't mind, I would like to hear it from you."

The master of the house sighed.

"As I said. My mother, father and wife are missing. They went out on a trip to visit her parents up north which they said wouldn't take a week. It has been a month since they should be back. I have sent a letter to her parents and they confirmed that my family had headed back home."

He paused, his face almost sobbing.

"I've asked the knights to look into it but they said that my family might have taken a detour. They aren't the kind to make plans without letting me know." his voice cracked as he finished his sentence.

Mahjuur had quietly listened to the story, thinking of the possible scenarios that were plausible. It could be that the Master of the house could be faking his worries and tears. But a man like him seems to wear his heart on his sleeves. Mahjuur looked around, seeing the painted pictures of his family and the numerous mana photos littered on the table. This man was distraught beyond comprehension. 

"Then a few questions for you..." the butler stepped in and stopped Mahjuur. 

"If you don't mind me answering on behalf of my master. It seems my master needs his rest."

Mahjuur looked at Leofric as he planted his face in his hands and began to sob.

"That will be alright with me. Shall we?" Mahjuur stood up and walked out with the butler. 

"What is it that you would like to know Mr Mahjuur?" 

"How is the Bradleye family like? Are they close?"

The butler began explaining that the Bradleye's were a well regarded family. They were a family of scholars who were close to one another. He could not think of anyone who would have ill-will towards the family. Leofric's wife and her family was similar too. There was none that would ever think of harming the family. Mahjuur asked if any other tragedies and events that had happened to the family before this. The butler shared how a few months back, Leofric's uncle died in a freak accident related to his research. It was so terrible that the body could not be identified.

"I remember that. It was in the news. My condolences."

"Thank you. It was a difficult time for the family. He was a good man. Always in his research."

"What exactly was his research?" 

"It was based on human body and psyche."

The answer piqued his curiosity.

"Is it okay if I went to his house?"

"That could be arranged. When would you like to go?"

"Now please."

It didn't take long for Mahjuur and the two men to get there. The house was covered with overgrown ivy and grasses. Graham the Butler, opened up the gates and doors without much difficulty. The insides of the house was dusty. Furniture draped with white linens to prevent the dust from settling on it. Mahjuur looked around and stumbled into the living room with its tall walls covered in bookshelves full of books. 

"Your uncle was a studious man I see." Mahjuur told Bradleye.

"Indeed he was. He's well versed in many subjects."

Mahjuur began walking about, touching the shelves. Then he stopped on one particular shelf. He felt something amiss. He closed his eye and softly chanted a detection spell. There was something hollow behind the shelf. Nobody would have noticed due to the layers of concealing magic being used to hide it. It didn't matter to him. Within a second, he had dispelled the magic, the bookshelf creaking from its weight. He swung it open. The master and butler was shocked to see the shelf opening up.

"Your uncle seems to have a hobby he doesn't want you to know."

Mahjuur peered into the opened door. The tunnel had steps running down and was dimly lit by mana crystals. 

"I would advice you to stay here Mr Leofric."

"Not a chance. I must see what's in there." 

Mahjuur looked at Leofric. His face showing concern for what's ahead. 

"Then promise me you'll run away when I tell you to."

Mahjuur didn't want to add more worries to the two gentlemen. He had intentionally left out a worrying information. When he had casted his detection magic, he felt a large mana irregularity underneath as well. He couldn't be sure as to why there was one but felt that it could be another matter altogether. 

The three of them walked down the steps. It took them awhile to reach the end. It opened up to a larger room as dimly lit as the tunnel, filled with laboratory equipment and shelves full of books. Tables full of glass jars and vials, with surgical tools neatly laid out neatly. Mahjuur looked around and found the dial to the mana lights. He turned them and the room lit brighter. 

As the room began to get more visible, he saw larger jars at the end of the room. And in them were brains. He moved closer to discern how or why were they there. It was suspended in some form of liquid. He touched the jar and immediately winced as he felt a jolt in his brain. He opened up his eyes and stared into the brain again. He knew whose it was. 

"You need to get out of here fast." Mahjuur turned to look at the two gentlemen. 

"Why the hurry." An unfamiliar voice spoke, through their minds. It felt uncomfortable.

"Go now!" Mahjuur shouted.

The ground shook and the wall behind the table seated with the brains crumbled down, revealing and even larger room. There was a giant glass vat with an oversized brain floating in it. The ground didn't stop quaking. Metallic tentacle like arms came out of the room and the vat began moving into the room they were in. 

"My dear nephew, how are you? Care to join me?" a tentacle began reaching for Leofric. 

Mahjuur shot an ice spear, freezing the tentacle in place. But soon enough, it broke free off the ice. The vat began to appear much clearly into the room. It was resting on a metallic plate like structure with tentacles supporting it. It began to chuckle.

"What do you think of my ascendance nephew? Is it not marvellous?"

"Frankly, I find it disgusting." Mahjuur replied.

A tentacle came swinging down on Mahjuur. An  ice wall erected, freezing the tentacle in place.

"Leofric, "
